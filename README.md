## Project Overview

The project encompasses the following key components:

### 1. Data Collection

The dataset used for this project was carefully collected to ensure diversity and representation of various fabric defects.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA was conducted to gain insights into the dataset. Visualizations and statistical summaries can be found in the notebook under the EDA section.

### 3. Data Preprocessing

Prior to model training, data preprocessing steps were implemented. This includes handling missing values, normalization, and any other necessary transformations. Details are provided in the notebook.

### 4. Model Training and Predictions

A deep learning model was developed and trained on the preprocessed dataset for fabric defect detection. Predictions were made on test data, and evaluation metrics can be found in the notebook.

### 5. Streamlit App

To make fabric defect detection accessible and user-friendly, a Streamlit app was developed. The app allows users to interactively upload images and visualize the model's predictions.

## Getting Started
